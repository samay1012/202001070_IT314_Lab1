Q1. The functional and non-functional requirements are as follows:-

Functional requirements: These are the requirements that are demanded by the end user as the basic facilities.
In the case of Library Information System, the following will be the functional requirements:

Easy Access:
1) The user should be able to easily find out their required book based on the name, release date, author etc.
2) Keeping a record of the books accessed by the user and updating the data based on his recent activity.

Updation of data:
1) Librarian is easily able to add or remove the books based on the requirements.
2) Allowing the user to extend the borrowing date if there is no other demand for the same book.

Overdue notification:
1) The users get notified if they do not return the book before the decided date.


Non-functional requirements: These are the quality constraints that need to be satisfied by the system.

Security:
1) The data of the users should remain within the library system and not get leaked anywhere.
2) To ensure that the books issued are returned properly within the stipulated time period.

Reliability
1) The system should be such that it can be trusted upon considering that it has a huge amount of data.

Performance
1) The system should respond properly to the requests that are sent to it.
2) The system should provide a smooth experience without any lags to the staff and the users.

Scalability
1) The system should be able to expand its database and accomodate new users whenever needed.
2) If there are multiple libraries, then the data should be stored in a database and be available in all the libraries i.e. the data should be scalable.

Q2. The following are the scope, functional and non-functional requirements:

Project Scope:
1) Planning: Designing a system that detects high volume sounds and immediately alerts the user based on it.
2) Controlling: First we propose a basic design of the system. After that we implement the design to an actual working system. Based on our output, we may or may not consider the modifications.
3) Closing: We do a detailed assessment of our final system with the one that we had planned to design.

Functional requirements:

1) Recognizing high volume sounds.
2) Alerting the user based on the sounds.
3) Very less or no delay in case of alerting the user.
4) AI enabled with strong sense of recognizing the sounds of car horns, babies etc.

Non-functional requirements:

Reliability
1) The system should be trustworthy in providing alerts at the right time to users.

Security
1) The personal data of users should remain secure within the system.

Performance
1) The system should be high performing in the sense that it gives accurate alerts to the user.
2) The system should alert the user only when needed and not on every sound that is heard.

Scalability
1) As stated that approx 5% of the world population is suffering from hearing loss, we need to attempt to scale the system to each individual for their safety and security.
